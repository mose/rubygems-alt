RubyGems-alt
=======================

A webhook simple reciever for RubyGems. For a long time I was checking out all new gems on twitter when goint to the geek cave every day, and life was all good. But then on september 1st 2012, the flow suddenly stopped ! Damn, something is broken. Ok, that will come back ... Well, on sept. 13th it was obvious that it won't come back that fast and then I missed my twitter feed too much so I wrote a new one.

It uses the excellent [Twitter](https://github.com/sferik/twitter) gem and and the fabulous [Eventmachine](http://rubyeventmachine.com/) engine for the webhooks server.
